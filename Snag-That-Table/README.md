Mission Statement 

For those who hate Valentine’s Day, this app is for you! 

“My perfect Valentine's day? I'm at home, three cell phones in front of me, fielding desperate calls from people who want to buy one of the fifty restaurant reservations I made over six months ago. -Dwight Schrute” - Snag-That-Table Developers

Be like Dwight, and book not one, but fifty restaurant reservations through our innovative app, Snag-That-Table, where you can be the middleman between two lovers and their Applebee’s four-cheese mac and cheese paradise. Or, you know, just snag a table in advance to perfect your family’s weekend dining experience.
